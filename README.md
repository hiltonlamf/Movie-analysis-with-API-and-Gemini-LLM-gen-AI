# Movie Analysis Using Web Scraping and Gemini LLM Gen AI

By leveraging their public API, I use datasets from TMDB, a popular movie and TV review platform, to explore key trends in the film industry. Using Python, I clean and preprocess the data before analysing patterns such as production volume and popularity by country, genre-based popularity, and the relationship between budget and popularity. Additionally, I leverage the **Gemini LLM API** to identify common themes among top-performing movies.
